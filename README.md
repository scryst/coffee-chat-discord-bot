## Features

- 🔄 Create coffee chat requests with topics and descriptions
- 🌐 Cross-server functionality to connect with users from different servers
- 👥 Simple menu-based UI with interactive buttons
- 💬 Private conversations through the bot's DMs
- 📊 Basic statistics tracking for users

- ⏱️ Duration tracking for coffee chats
- 📁 Support for file and image sharing during chats
- 👤 Display of both username and display name for better identification
- 🎨 Stylized messages and embeds for improved user experience

## Commands

The bot uses a single command with a menu-based UI:

- `/coffee` - Opens the main menu with buttons for all functionality

## Menu Options

From the main menu, users can:
- **Request Coffee Chat** - Create a new coffee chat request
- **View Requests** - Browse and accept pending coffee chat requests
- **My Stats** - View personal coffee chat statistics
- **Leaderboard** - View the coffee chat leaderboard
- **Cancel My Request** - Cancel your pending coffee chat request

## How It Works

1. A user opens the menu with `/coffee` and selects "Request Coffee Chat"
2. They fill out a modal with topic and description
3. The request appears in the channel with an Accept button
4. Other users can view and accept requests through the menu
5. When another user accepts, both users are connected through the bot's DMs
6. All messages sent to the bot are relayed to the other participant with display name and username
7. Either user can end the chat by clicking the "End Chat" button
8. After ending a chat, users receive a stylized summary with chat duration
9. Statistics are tracked for each user and displayed on leaderboards

2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file with your Discord bot token:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   ```
4. Run the bot with `python bot.py`

## Database

The bot uses SQLite to store:
- User information
- Server information
- Coffee chat requests
- Active chats
- Chat history
- Message history
- Statistics for users

## Hosting on Replit

2. Upload all files from this repository

3. Enable the necessary intents (Members and Message Content)
4. Generate an invite link with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes

## Required Permissions

The bot requires the following permissions:
- Read Messages/View Channels

## Privacy Considerations

- All messages sent during coffee chats are relayed through the bot
- Message content is stored in the database for record-keeping
