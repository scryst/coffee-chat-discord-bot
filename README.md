# ‚òï Coffee Chat Discord Bot

A Discord bot that facilitates spontaneous coffee chats between server members, similar to Yggdrasil's telephone feature.

## Features

- üîÑ On-demand coffee chat requests at any time
- üë• Simple accept/decline interface with interactive buttons
- üí¨ Conversations take place through the bot's DMs
- üìä Track coffee chat statistics and history
- üîî Direct message notifications for participants
- ‚è±Ô∏è Duration tracking for coffee chats

## How It Works

1. A user requests a coffee chat using the `/coffee` command
2. The request appears in the channel with Accept/Decline buttons
3. When another user accepts, both users are connected through the bot's DMs
4. All messages sent to the bot are relayed to the other participant
5. Either user can end the chat when they're done with `/coffee_end`
6. Statistics are tracked for each user

## Commands

- `/coffee` - Request a coffee chat
- `/coffee_cancel` - Cancel your pending request
- `/coffee_end` - End your active coffee chat
- `/coffee_stats` - View your coffee chat statistics
- `/coffee_help` - Show help information
