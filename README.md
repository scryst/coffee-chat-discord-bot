## Features

- 🔄 Create coffee chat requests with topics and descriptions
- 🌐 Cross-server functionality to connect with users from different servers
- 👥 Simple menu-based UI with interactive buttons that adapt to user's current state
- 💬 Private conversations through the bot's DMs
- 📊 Comprehensive statistics tracking for users
- 🔔 Direct message notifications for participants
- ⏱️ Duration tracking for coffee chats
- 📁 Support for file and image sharing during chats
- 👤 Display of both username and display name for better identification
- 🎨 Stylized messages and embeds with consistent color schemes for different chat states
- 🔄 Dynamic UI updates with in-place message editing
- 🔒 Robust state management to prevent conflicting actions
- 🕒 Consistent timestamp formatting across all chat stages
- 🚫 Automatic cancellation of pending requests when accepting another request
- 🔄 Smart button visibility based on user's current state

## Commands

The bot uses a single command with a menu-based UI:

- `/coffee` - Opens the main menu with buttons for all functionality

## Menu Options

From the main menu, users can:
- **Request Coffee Chat** - Create a new coffee chat request
- **View Requests** - Browse and accept pending coffee chat requests
- **My Stats** - View personal coffee chat statistics
- **Leaderboard** - View the coffee chat leaderboard
- **Cancel My Request** - Cancel your pending coffee chat request
- **End Current Chat** - End your active coffee chat (only shown when in an active chat)

## How It Works

1. A user opens the menu with `/coffee` and selects "Request Coffee Chat"
2. They fill out a modal with topic and description
3. The request appears in the channel with an Accept button
4. Other users can view and accept requests through the menu
5. When another user accepts, both users are connected through the bot's DMs
6. All messages sent to the bot are relayed to the other participant with display name and username
7. Either user can end the chat by clicking the "End Chat" button
8. After ending a chat, users receive a stylized summary with chat duration
9. Statistics are tracked for each user and displayed on leaderboards
10. "Coffee Chat In Progress" messages automatically update to "Coffee Chat Completed" after the chat ends
11. Chat status updates appear in both the server where the request was made and the server/DM where it was accepted
12. Accepting a cross-server request automatically cancels your current request if you have one
13. Users cannot create multiple requests or join chats while in an active chat
14. The UI dynamically adapts to show only relevant options based on the user's current state

## User State Management

The bot implements sophisticated state management to track:
- If a user is in an active chat
- If a user has a pending request
- If a user has no active interactions

This state management ensures users can only perform actions that make sense for their current state:
- Users in active chats see "End Current Chat" instead of "Request Coffee Chat"
- Users cannot create multiple requests
- Users cannot accept requests while in an active chat
- Users cannot cancel requests while in an active chat

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file with your Discord bot token and other credentials:
   ```
   # Required
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   
   # Optional but recommended
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   
   # OAuth URL (generated with generate_oauth_url.py)
   DISCORD_OAUTH_URL=your_oauth_url_here
   ```
4. Run the bot with `python bot.py`

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Bot Core (`bot.py`)**: Main entry point and event handler
2. **Coffee Commands (`cogs/coffee_commands.py`)**: Implements the /coffee command and all button interactions
3. **Message Handler (`utils/message_handler.py`)**: Manages message relay and formatting
4. **UI Components (`utils/ui.py`)**: Defines custom UI elements like buttons and views
5. **Database Manager (`utils/database.py`)**: Handles all database operations
6. **Error Handler (`cogs/error_handler.py`)**: Manages error handling and logging

### Key Technical Features

- **Dynamic UI**: Buttons and views adapt based on user's current state

## Required Permissions

The bot requires the following permissions:
- Read Messages/View Channels
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Attach Files
- Use Slash Commands
- Read Message History

## Privacy Considerations

- All messages sent during coffee chats are relayed through the bot
- Message content is stored in the database for record-keeping
- Users can end chats at any time
- The bot only processes messages in DMs during active coffee chats
- For full details, see our [Privacy Policy](docs/privacy.html)
- By using the bot, users agree to our [Terms of Service](docs/terms.html)

## Security Measures

- User interactions are validated before processing
- Credentials are managed via environment variables
- OAuth with restricted permissions
- Input sanitization for all user-provided content
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure database transactions

## Future Enhancements

- Rating system for coffee chats
- More detailed statistics and analytics
- Scheduled coffee chats
- Topic-based matching
- AI-powered conversation starters
- Integration with other platforms
- Customizable chat duration limits
- Server-specific configuration options
- Advanced matching algorithms
- Internationalization support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not responding to commands**
   - Ensure the bot has proper permissions
   - Check if the bot is online
   - Verify slash commands are registered

2. **Database errors**
   - Check file permissions for the SQLite database
   - Ensure no other process is locking the database

3. **Message relay issues**
   - Verify the bot can send DMs to users
   - Check if users have DMs enabled

### Debugging

The bot uses Python's logging module with different log levels:
- INFO: General operational information
- WARNING: Potential issues that don't affect functionality
- ERROR: Problems that affect functionality
- DEBUG: Detailed information for troubleshooting
